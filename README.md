# Commander Hadfield alarm clock

A thing that checks when @cmdr_hadfield tweets his first tweet of the day. Part of Space Apps Challenge project with @hyper_linda

Call +44 1772 44 1337 to active the alarm

It will call you when Chris Hadfield wakes up and also sometimes when there is an error.

Commander Hadfield usually gets up between 6.40 and 7.20 UCT+1 on weekdays. No gurantees whatsoever.
